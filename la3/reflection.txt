Reflection Questions			James Irvin


One reason quick sort might be prefered to quick sort by some people is due 
to its lower memory requirements. This is because the way quick sort is implimented
it does not use recursion as much as merge sort does.

The merge sort implimentation has the ability to sort by the length of the string
which our quick sort implimentation does not.
